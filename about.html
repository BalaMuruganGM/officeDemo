                In 2003 under the aegis of DPS Society, the OmDayal Group opened the gates of DPS Ruby Park, the most preferred CBSE school in Kolkata, with the vision of raising the benchmark of the standard of education in West Bengal. The inauguration of DPS Durgapur in 2011 was yet another significant step taken towards achieving the same.
                <br><br>
                Another landmark of OmDayal Group is the NAAC accredited ‘OmDayal Group of Institutions – Engineering and Architectural College’. Set up in 2010 at Uluberia, Howrah, this undergraduate college is approved by AICTE & COA and is affiliated to MAKAUT. The institution added a new dimension to the vision of revolutionizing technical education in West Bengal.
                <br><br>
                For engineering and medical aspirants, Vidyamandir Classes, Kolkata was established in 2015, in collaboration with Delhi’s most popular coaching institute for Engineering (IIT, NIT and other premier engineering colleges) and Medical (AIIMS & NEET) Entrance Examinations.
                <br><br>
                Following the footsteps of DPS Ruby Park and DPS Durgapur, our latest venture Ruby Park Public School is all set to create a new benchmark in school education in Kolkata.
